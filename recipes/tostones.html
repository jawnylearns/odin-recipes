    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Tostones are a prominent dish found within the Caribbean and Latin America.
    They are crisp, flattened plantains that are usually served as appetizers
    or side dishes. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><em>For around 3-4 servings</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 green(unripe) plantains (about 6 ounces each)</li>
        <li>Neutral oil, such as vegetable or canola oil, for frying</li>
        <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preperation</h2>
    <p><strong>Step 1.</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Trim and discard the ends of the plantains.</li>
        <li>Use a praing knife to cut a slit along the length of
        the plantain to easily remove the peel, carefully avoiding cutting
        into the flesh. </li>
        <li>If the peel is too firm, use a spoon to lift the edges, 
        then discard the peel.</li>
        <li>Slice the plantain crosswise into 1-inch rounds (about 
        8 pieces per plantain). </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Step 2.</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat about 1/8-inch vegetable oil
        over medium.</li>
        <li>When the oil shimmers, add the plantains, flat-side down.</li>
        <li>Fry until beginning to turn golden, about 1 minute per side.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Step 3.</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>While keeping the heat on, transfer plantains to a cutting
        board.</li>
        <li>Working with one piece at a time, use a tostonera or large
        flat-bottomed cup to gently press each plantains to about 1/2-inch
        thick. (If using a cup, keep it as a centered as possible to 
        flatten the plantains evenly.)</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Step 4.</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Working in batches if necessary to avoid crowding the pan,
        pan-fry the flattened plantains until golden-brown, 1 to 2 
        minutes per side.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Step 5.</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a slotted spoon, transfer tostones to a paper towel
        -lined plate to drain.</li>
        <li>While hot, season with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Time to Serve! :)</li>
